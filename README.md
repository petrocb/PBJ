# To Do
1.fix ema
2.do ema conditions 
3.look in to fib

# Indicator Ideas
Code up the Very Wet Ass Pussy  
Create bollinger bands that are 1 standard deviation away from the VWAP that act as support and resistance levels 
Combine this with  EMA to show when trending down or  up from the bollinger 

Need some logic like:
- if hit top bollinger last and ST EMA cross below LT EMA then Sell order
- combine with trailing stop
- if hit bottom bollinger last and ST EMA cross above LT EMA then Buy order
